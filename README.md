# Roomba_Assignments

## What and Why?
This repository is made to revisit a series of assignments that were given to me in an Honors programming course now that I have the fortune of knowing:
- How to use Git and GitHub
- Not having to worry about deadlines
- Not struggling on knowing the material

Additionally, I find pride in my work and look forward to make my work as efficient and pretty as I can to demonstrate my proficiency in C++.

This project was created in Visual Studio 2022. Each assignment directory were created with their respective project (.vcxproj) file. 
The solution (.sln) file lies in the root of the repository (where the .git directory is in).
